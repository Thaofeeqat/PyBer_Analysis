# PyBer_Analysis
The PyBer analysis was carried out to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, the data was derived from excel csv file and was imported in pyhton jupyter notebook using pandas and matplotlib.
## Deliverabe One
I was able to analysis the dataframe summary such as the total number of ride,drivers and fares using pandas groupby function,sum function and count functions for each city type. Also in this analysis I calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type.

The image above shows that Urban city type gets more ride and have more drivers that the rural and surban cities.
